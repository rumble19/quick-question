echo "‚úÖ Method 1: Quoted input (always works)"
echo "Command: qq \"What's the difference between Rust and Python?\""
echo

echo "‚úÖ Method 2: Interactive mode (perfect for complex questions)"
echo "Command: qq"
echo "Then type: What's going on? How does this work? Don't worry about quotes!"
echo

echo "‚úÖ Method 3: Piped input (great for scripting)"
echo "Command: echo \"Complex question with 'quotes' and symbols!\" | qq"
echo

echo "‚úÖ Method 4: No arguments (auto-interactive mode)"
echo "Command: qq"
echo "Then type your question when prompted"
echo

echo "‚ùå Old problem (now handled gracefully):"
echo "Command: qq What's happening? Don't use quotes!"
echo "Result: Shell breaks due to unmatched quotes"
echo "Now: App detects the issue and offers interactive input!"
echo

echo "üí° The app now intelligently handles:"
echo "   - Apostrophes (don't, won't, can't)"
echo "   - Question marks and exclamation points"
echo "   - Mixed quotes and special characters"
echo "   - Multi-word questions without quotes"
echo

echo "üîß Usage recommendations:"
echo "   - For simple questions: qq \"your question\""
echo "   - For complex questions: qq"
echo "   - For automation: echo \"question\" | qq"
